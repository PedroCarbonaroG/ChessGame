# Chess Game Repository

This repository houses a comprehensive implementation of a chess game using Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, design patterns, code structuring, and other relevant concepts.

## Project Overview

### Chess Implementation
The repository includes a fully functional chess game that demonstrates the application of OOP principles and design patterns. Key features and aspects covered in the project:

- Complete implementation using Java
- Utilization of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Integration of design patterns for code organization and maintainability
- Chessboard representation and piece movements
- Player turns and game logic
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions
- Special moves like enpassant, piece promotion and castling(rocks)
- Input validation and error handling

### Code Structure
The project adheres to best practices for code structuring, readability, and maintainability. The repository is segmented into logical sections for easy navigation and comprehension.
